# Content-Aware-Image-Resizing
Project implemented using Python with Dynamic Programming Algorithm. The Project uses Numba Library for converting the Interpreted language to Compliled Language, which leads in acceleration of the Python execution speed. The algorithm used was initially proposed in order to protect the Content of the Image which might be lost in case we just resize the image by shortening the edges.
